## Description

This is a sound-playing utility for C++ apps that can asynchronously start and stop music loops, as well as initiate transient sounds, and allow unlimited sound concurrency.

It plays WAV files, via OpenAL, and runs on Windows, OSX, and linux platforms. Nice examples are included.

It is suitable for any Cpp application that needs music, sound loops or transient sound effects; eg. games.

There are no software dependencies;  this utility is self-contained.

--------------------------------------------------------
## Usage:

See the simple interface description in file snd4cpp.hpp.

Generally, when you initialize a sound or soundloop, you specify its file name and retrieve an integer "key" that is used to play it sometime later.

Note: an error occurs if there is something fishy about the WAV file. I always get good results with WAV files output from, or processed through "sox".

========================================================
## What is so great about this package?

This package is a non-platform-specific C++ code that uses Pthreads and compiles on Windows, OSX and Linux. It is used in my games RufasGate & RufasSliders (on SourceForge and GitHub).


========================================================

## Examples:

See ./examples/one.adb
See ./examples/two.adb

The examples come with 3 compilation scripts: lcmp.sh, ocmp.sh, wcmp.bat
These scripts assume your c++ compiler is visible.

Note that the Windows executables need to be colocated with

	openal32.dll
		&
	pthreadGC2.dll

in order to run. (included).
